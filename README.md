## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties;
- Flexbox;
- Mobile-first workflow.

### What I learned

That was my first attempt at mobile-first development. I found it easier to adapt the design from mobile to desktop than the other way around.

### Continued development

Responsiveness and mobile-first development are concepts that I'm going to keep on studying and practicing until I feel like I've gotten a good grip on them.
